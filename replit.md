# Mastermind VPS Management System

## Overview

This is a comprehensive VPS management system that provides centralized control over multiple proxy services and system monitoring. The application consists of a Flask web interface for management and four different proxy servers (HTTP, SOCKS, TCP bypass, and proxy manager) with advanced features for network traffic handling and bypass capabilities.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Web Framework**: Flask-based web application with Jinja2 templating
- **Static Assets**: CSS3 with custom styling using CSS variables for theming
- **JavaScript**: Vanilla JavaScript with class-based architecture for real-time updates
- **UI Components**: Responsive dashboard with Font Awesome icons and Chart.js integration

### Backend Architecture
- **Main Application**: Flask web server (`web/app.py`) handling HTTP requests and system management
- **Proxy Services**: Four independent Python proxy servers:
  - HTTP/HTTPS Proxy (`proxies/http-proxy.py`)
  - SOCKS4/5 Proxy (`proxies/socks-proxy.py`) 
  - TCP Bypass Proxy (`proxies/tcp-bypass.py`)
  - Proxy Manager (`proxies/proxy-manager.py`)
- **Process Management**: Direct subprocess management with psutil for system monitoring

### Data Storage Solutions
- **Primary Database**: SQLite3 for user management, service configurations, and logs
- **File System Storage**: 
  - Configuration files in `/etc/mastermind/`
  - Log files in `/var/log/mastermind/`
  - Cache storage in `/var/cache/mastermind-proxy/`

## Key Components

### Web Interface (`web/app.py`)
- **DatabaseManager Class**: Handles SQLite operations for users, services, and audit logs
- **Authentication System**: Session-based authentication with password hashing
- **System Monitoring**: Real-time CPU, memory, disk, and network statistics via psutil
- **Service Management**: Start/stop/restart functionality for proxy services

### Proxy Services
- **HTTP Proxy**: Full-featured HTTP/HTTPS proxy with caching, authentication, and monitoring
- **SOCKS Proxy**: SOCKS4/5 support with user authentication and connection tracking
- **TCP Bypass**: Advanced DPI circumvention with packet fragmentation and domain fronting
- **Proxy Manager**: Centralized Flask-based management interface for all proxy services

### Frontend Components
- **Dashboard**: Real-time system statistics with auto-refresh functionality
- **Service Management**: Control panel for proxy service lifecycle management
- **Monitoring**: System health visualization and alerts
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface with modern CSS Grid/Flexbox

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Login credentials validated against SQLite database
2. **Dashboard Updates**: JavaScript polls Flask endpoints every 10 seconds for system stats
3. **Service Control**: Web interface sends commands to proxy manager, which manages subprocess lifecycle
4. **Monitoring Data**: psutil gathers system metrics, displayed via Chart.js visualizations
5. **Logging**: All services log to separate files, aggregated in web interface
6. **Proxy Traffic**: Independent proxy servers handle client connections directly

## External Dependencies

### Python Packages
- **Flask**: Web framework for main interface and proxy manager
- **psutil**: System and process monitoring
- **sqlite3**: Database operations (built-in)
- **ssl**: TLS/SSL support for secure connections
- **subprocess**: Process management for proxy services

### System Dependencies
- **Directory Structure**: Requires `/var/log/mastermind/`, `/etc/mastermind/`, `/var/cache/mastermind-proxy/`
- **File Permissions**: Services run as root for privileged port binding
- **Network Access**: Proxy services bind to standard ports (8000, 8080, 1080)

### Frontend Dependencies
- **Font Awesome 6.0.0**: Icon library (CDN)
- **Chart.js 3.9.1**: Data visualization (CDN)
- **Modern Browser**: ES6+ JavaScript support required

## Deployment Strategy

### Installation Requirements
- **Operating System**: Linux-based system (paths suggest Ubuntu/Debian)
- **Python Version**: Python 3.x with standard library
- **Privileges**: Root access required for system monitoring and privileged ports
- **Network**: Firewall configuration for proxy ports (8000, 8080, 1080)

### Service Architecture
- **Standalone Deployment**: Each proxy service runs as independent Python process
- **Web Interface**: Flask development server (production would require WSGI server)
- **Process Management**: Manual start/stop via proxy manager or systemd integration
- **Monitoring**: Built-in system monitoring without external dependencies

### Configuration Management
- **Database Initialization**: Automatic SQLite schema creation on first run
- **Default Credentials**: Hardcoded authentication databases in proxy services
- **Log Rotation**: Manual log management (no automatic rotation configured)
- **Cache Management**: HTTP proxy includes cache size and age limits
